By using the FSM, consider the potential possible paths of execution
that can be taken, and write tests for each.

Remember to reset before testing and after each test.

Remember to add a clock.

Annotate the FSM diagram with the expected outputs, to make it easier to follow the waveform.

All tests should be checked before uploading to FPGA.

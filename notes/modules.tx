Carefully consider the FSM when creating the `always` loops.

Don't use `assign`, it is becoming redundant and can be replaced with `always`.

Use MACROS to make the code more readable.

Combinatorial (non-stateful) logic should have = assignments (blocking)

Sequential (stateful) logic should have <= assignments (non-blocking)

If and case statements can be nested, but no whitespace within the always statement.

# ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized...
# ** Warning: (vsim-3865) Due to PLI being present, global +acc is being enabled automatically. This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. Please use vsim -no_autoacc to disable this feature. This feature is now deprecated and will be removed from future releases.
# ** Warning: (vopt-10587) Some optimizations are turned off because the +acc switch is in effect. This will cause your simulation to run slowly. Please use -access/-debug to maintain needed visibility.
# ** Warning: (vopt-2009) At least one design unit was compiled with optimization level -O0 or -O1.
# Use vdir -l command to find such design units.
